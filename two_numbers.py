# Create a program that prints a few operations on two numbers: 22 and 13

# Print the result of 13 added to 22

# Print the result of 13 substracted from 22

# Print the result of 22 multiplied by 13

# Print the result of 22 divided by 13 (as a decimal fraction)

# Print the integer part of 22 divided by 13

# Print the remainder of 22 divided by 13

# Values defined
a = 22
b = 13

# Addition of 22 and 13
add = a + b
print(add)

# Subtraction of 22 and 13
sub = a - b
print(sub)

# Multiplication of 22 and 13
mul = a * b
print(mul)

# The integer part of 22 divided by 13
print(int(a / b))

# Reminder of 22 divided by 13
print(a % b)
